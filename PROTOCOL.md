# Benchmark protocol

Current protocol version: **1.1.0**.

The purpose of this protocol is reproducibility, not producing the largest
possible number.

## Comparability rules

Two runs are directly comparable only when all of these match:

- benchmark protocol version, prompt-corpus SHA256, and comparison ID;
- run counts, output limits, sampling fields, and extra request body;
- cache-busting/immediate-replay prefill depths and run count;
- concurrency levels, rounds, workload, and output limit;
- staggered-arrival levels, rounds, depth, caps, delay, and workload; and
- the server-side definition of a prompt and completion token.

For a topology-only claim, model weights, immutable model and drafter
revisions, serving engine/image, quantisation, KV dtype, context limit,
speculative configuration, and scheduler must also match. If they do not, call
it an appliance or recipe comparison.

## Decode

The fixed corpus contains code, prose, and structured workloads. Nonces are
deterministically derived from the protocol version, comparison ID, workload,
and run number. Two appliances in a sweep therefore receive byte-identical
prompts, while a new comparison ID prevents accidental cache reuse in a later
sweep. Temperature is zero, `top_p` is one, and the seed is fixed.
Model-specific fields such as thinking mode are supplied through
`--extra-body`, recorded verbatim, and must match. They cannot override the
fixed benchmark fields.

No universal "thinking off" profile is defined because model templates do not
implement that control consistently. A no-thinking run is a model-specific
ceiling and must use a separate comparison ID and label. It is comparable only
with a receipt carrying the identical extra request body.

The chunk-timed decode estimate is `(completion_tokens - 1) /
(last_output_event_time - first_output_event_time)`. It deliberately excludes
prefill. Server-reported token usage is mandatory. An SSE event can contain
more than one token, so this is an estimate unless the server emits one token
per event. RigMark records the number of measured events and refuses to report
a decode rate when a completion is buffered into one measurable event. The
report publishes the median, minimum, maximum, and p90 of every workload; the
best run is never the headline.

Completion tokens and decode timing cover the complete streamed generation,
including reasoning where a server exposes it separately from visible output.
The result records visible and reasoning character counts independently. The
basic output gate rejects a reasoning-only stream; it is not a correctness
claim.

Structured JSON is an explicitly labelled speculative-decoding ceiling. It is
not a proxy for prose, coding, or agent responsiveness. Its output is checked
against the requested array and every result records whether validation passed.
Visible outputs are retained so that code, prose, truncation, and looping can
be audited. Reasoning text is represented only by its character count and hash.
Code and prose pass the basic output gate only when they emit a non-empty
visible answer and report a normal `stop`. New receipts also require the SSE
`[DONE]` marker. Structured output must meet those conditions and match every
requested value. This is not a correctness score. It rejects obvious
reasoning-only, truncated, filtered, tool-call, or prematurely ended responses.

Time to last output runs from request start through the last visible or
reasoning output. Response wall time additionally includes usage and HTTP/SSE
tail handling. Both are retained; the former is the user-facing end-to-end
latency shown beside decode rate.

## Prefill

The prefill test uses the server's `/tokenize` endpoint to create exact token-ID
prompts, then sends those IDs to `/v1/completions`. Each pair has its own
deterministic nonce, which defeats the prefix cache for the first request. The
identical token list is immediately replayed. “Cold” therefore means
cache-busting, not a cold model or cold kernels; “immediate replay” does not
claim that a cache hit was independently observed. The default suite reports
the median and range of three pairs at each depth.

Effective prefill rate is `prompt_tokens / time_to_first_token`. It includes
fixed request and scheduling overhead, so shallow and deep prompt depths should
both be published. RigMark refuses a sample unless the server-reported prompt
token count exactly equals the requested token-ID depth, and refuses a depth
that cannot fit its eight generated tokens inside the declared context limit.

The decode suite works with OpenAI-compatible chat servers. Exact
cache-busting/immediate-replay prefill additionally requires vLLM-compatible
`/tokenize` and token-ID completion input; use `--skip-prefill` when an engine
lacks these extensions.

## Concurrency

All requests in a round wait on a barrier before opening their HTTP streams.
Each receives a unique nonce. Reports include aggregate end-to-end throughput,
per-stream decode, and per-stream TTFT. Aggregate throughput includes prefill
and scheduling delay and therefore describes service capacity rather than the
decode kernel alone.

## Staggered arrivals (optional)

The barrier concurrency suite starts every request at once, so it never shows
what happens when a request arrives while others are already being served: a
long prompt admitted into a running decode batch, or short requests queued
behind a long prefill. `--staggered LEVELS` adds that measurement. Each level is
a total concurrency of running plus arriving requests, and each round measures
both directions:

- **decode-first**: `LEVEL-1` short chat streams (the staggered workload, capped
  by `--staggered-incumbent-tokens`) are started on a barrier. After every one
  of them has produced its first output and `--staggered-delay` seconds have
  passed, one exact-token long request of `--staggered-depth` prompt tokens
  arrives (capped by `--staggered-arrival-tokens`). Reported: the arriving
  request's TTFT and its ratio to a solo run of the same depth performed just
  before (a different cache-busting nonce), and the incumbents' delivery stalls:
  the whole-stream p95 interval between SSE events, plus the largest interval
  that ends between the arrival and its first output.
- **prefill-first**: the long request starts alone; after `--staggered-delay`
  seconds, and only if it has not produced output yet, `LEVEL-1` short chat
  requests arrive on a barrier. Reported: the short requests' median and maximum
  TTFT and the ratio to a solo short request, and how much the long request's
  TTFT grew against its solo value.

A round is valid only when the overlap really happened: every incumbent was
still streaming when the long request started, or every short request started
before the long request's first output. Invalid rounds are kept in the receipt
and excluded from the summaries; the card prints the valid/total count. The
prefill depth must satisfy the same context-limit rule as the prefill suite.
The suite is off unless `--staggered` is given, and its settings are part of
the comparability rules.

## Publishing a result

Publish the unedited JSON file and the exact command. Also disclose hardware,
topology, negotiated link speed, model and drafter revisions, serving image or
commit, quantisation, KV configuration, context limit, speculative depth, and
whether any other traffic shared the endpoint.

The JSON receipt and every share card record the benchmark repository commit
and whether its worktree was dirty when the run began. Source archives embed
the originating Git commit in `.git_archival.txt`, so the same revision is
recorded when the `.git` directory is unavailable. Dirty runs are retained,
not rejected. They include a fingerprint over tracked changes, untracked paths,
and untracked file contents, but a clean committed revision remains preferable
for a reproducible public reference.

The receipt SHA256 is a fingerprint of the published JSON bytes, not a digital
signature or independent attestation. Comparison and reporting recompute
summaries and basic gates from the raw rows before producing a card.
